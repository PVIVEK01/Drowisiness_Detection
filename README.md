The Drowsiness Detection project is a real-time system designed to monitor drivers and detect signs of drowsiness, helping to prevent accidents. Developed using Python, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, the project leverages webcam footage to analyze eye states and detect drowsiness. It employs advanced Deep Learning techniques to ensure high accuracy in identifying drowsiness. When drowsiness is detected, the system alerts the driver with an alarm. If the driver's eyes are closed, the music alarm will sound, and it will turn off when the driver's eyes are open. The project uses technologies such as OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, and Scikit-learn. To run the application, simply clone the repository, install the dependencies, and execute the script. Explore the code on GitHub and contribute to enhancing the system!
